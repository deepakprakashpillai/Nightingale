International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) includes heart failure and other cardiac complications of hypertension when a causal relationship between the heart disease and hypertension is
 stated or implied on the death certificate. According to ICD-10, hypertensive heart disease (I11) and its subcategories: hypertensive heart disease with heart failure (I11.0) and hypertensive heart 
disease without heart failure (I11.9) are distinguished from chronic rheumatic heart diseases (I05-I09), other forms of heart disease (I30-I52), and ischemic heart diseases (I20-I25). However, since
 high blood pressure is a risk factor for atherosclerosis and ischemic heart disease, death rates from hypertensive heart disease provide an incomplete measure of the burden of disease due to
